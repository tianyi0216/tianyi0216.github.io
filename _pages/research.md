Currently, my research focus on the application of data science, statistics and machine learning methods in solving real-world problems. Below are the details of my research experience.

## Research Experience

* **Effect of Fumigation on Microbiomes in Soil** , Jan 2023 - Present
  * This is my first research project. The project is about the effect of fumigation on microbiomes in soil and I am responsible to find patterns from a large microbial dataset. 
  * Identified important patterns within a hgih-dimensional, sparse and large dataset using various data visualization tools and skills such as NMDS and heatmap.
  * Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and constructed regression model to identify the change and
variance caused by different fumigation status.
  * Build microbial network using Glasso, Correlation and Dissimilarity matrix, CARlasso algorithm and conducted network inference to identify the relationship between OTUs and response variables.
  * Advisor: [Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus](https://crsl4.github.io/pages/about.html), PhD student Evan Gorstein.

* **Wildlife Sound Classification**, July 2023 - Present
  * Work in progress

* **Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification** , Feb 2023 - Present
  * This is my second research project. The project is about identify aggressive tumor features in Renal cell carcinoma using learning-based CV techniques. The previous group has extracted image slices with the tumor and important features. My job is to build and imporve a CNN to classify the images (high risk or low risk). 
  * Developed, and optimized a convolutional neural network using PyTorch for feature extraction from images.
Improved accuracy of the model in the testing stage from 60% to 95%.
  * Tested the CNN using various techniques including random naive testing and permutation tests.
  * In future, we are looking to further evaluate the model.
