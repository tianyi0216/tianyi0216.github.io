Currently, my research focus on the application of data science, statistics and machine learning methods in solving real-world problems. Below are the details of my research experience.

## Research Experience

* **Effect of Fumigation on Microbiomes in Soil** , Jan 2023 - Present
  * This is my first research project. The project is about the effect of fumigation on microbiomes in soil and I am responsible to find patterns from a large microbial dataset. 
  * Conducted Literature Review on Network Analysis/Inference algorithms to build a microbial network to study
the effect of fumigation on soil microbiomes.
  * Identified important patterns within a large dataset using various data visualization tools and skills. Specificially, I created several heatmaps which highlights the different microbial abundances between samples of different fumigation status.
  * Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and regression to identify the change and
variance caused by different fumigation status.
  * In future, we are looking to build a network to support our findings.
  * Advisor: [Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus](https://crsl4.github.io/pages/about.html), PhD student Evan Gorstein.

* **Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification** , Feb 2023 - Present
  * This is my second research project. The project is about identify aggressive tumor features in Renal cell carcinoma. The previous group has extracted image slices with the tumor and important features. My job is to build and imporve a deep learning model to classify the images (high risk or low risk). 
  * Developed, and optimized a convolutional neural network using PyTorch for feature extraction from images.
Improved accuracy of the model in the testing stage from 60% to 95%.
  * Tested the CNN using various techniques including random naive testing and permutation tests.
  * In future, we are looking to further evaluate the model.
