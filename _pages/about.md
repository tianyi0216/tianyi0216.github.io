I am a third-year student undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Computer Science, Data Science and Math. I have a broad interest in machine learning and computer vision. I am currently doing machine learning and data science research with Professor [Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus](https://crsl4.github.io/pages/about.html) at [Solis-Lemus Lab](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/research.html). I also worked on medical image classification and analysis with Professor [Dane Morgan](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/Faculty/Morgan_Dane/) at the [Informatic Skunkworks Group](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu/).
