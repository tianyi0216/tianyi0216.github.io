I am a third-year student undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Computer Science, Data Science and Math. I have broad interest in both the theoretical foundations and application of data science and machine learning. I am currently doing data science research with Professor [Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus](https://crsl4.github.io/pages/about.html) at [Solis-Lemus Lab](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/research.html). I also worked on deep learning research with medical image classification with Professor Dane Morgan.
