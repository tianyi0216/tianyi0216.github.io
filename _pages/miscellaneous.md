## Trombone
I have been playing trombone since 9. I studied in the [Qatar Music Academy](https://www.qatarmusicacademy.com.qa/) from 2014 - 2020 under [Dimo Pishtyalov](https://qatarphilharmonicorchestra.org/musicians/dimo-pishtyalov/). In general, I enjoy classical trombone more and prefer repertoires from classical and romantic period ~~because trombone only get to play for ~5 measures and then rest for 430 measures~~. I don't play often now but would still practice in my free time.


## Football
I am a fan of [Borussia Dortmund](https://www.bvb.de/eng) since 2013. 


## Japanese Pop Culture
I am a big fan of Japanese pop culture including animes, games and light novels. My future travel plan is to visit Japan and visit places that was shown in my favorite anime and games. (This is called 聖地巡礼). I am also self-studying Japanese in my spare time.

My favorite game studio is [KEY](https://key.visualarts.gr.jp/), a brand belongs to Visual Arts.
