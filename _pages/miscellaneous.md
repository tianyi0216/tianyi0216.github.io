I have been playing trombone since 9. I studied in the [Qatar Music Academy](https://www.qatarmusicacademy.com.qa/) from 2014 - 2020 under [Dimo Pishtyalov](https://qatarphilharmonicorchestra.org/musicians/dimo-pishtyalov/). In general, I enjoy classical trombone more and prefer repertoires from classical and romantic period ~~because trombone only get to play for ~5 measures and then rest for 430 measures~~. I don't play often now but would still practice in my free time.

I am also a fan of 2022-2023 Bundesliga winner [Borussia Dortmund](https://www.bvb.de/eng) since 2013. 

I am a big fan of Japanese pop culture including songs, animes, games and light novels.
